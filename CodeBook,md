Tidy data code book 
=================

The tidy data include average of each variable and over test and training data for each activity and each subject.

Original data selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
Explain of that origainal data you will find from Coursera Getting and cleaning data course's site.

Tidy data is group by 6 activivity factors 
Actitivy_ID 1:6
Activity_Description c("WALKING","WALKING_UPSTAIRS","WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS","SITTING","STANDING""LAYING")

Average is calculated over the activity for each variable mean and std.
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Variables of the feature vector for each pattern'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
For example:
Variable tBodyAcc-XYZ will appear in data
tBodyAcc_mean()_X
tBodyAcc_mean()_Y
tBodyAcc_mean()_Z
tBodyAcc_std()_X
tBodyAcc_std()_Y
tBodyAcc_std()_Z
